# DGMO Evolution System - LLM Pattern Analysis Enhancement

## Overview

The DGMO Evolution System now includes advanced LLM-based pattern analysis using Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
This enhancement dramatically improves the system's ability to detect complex usage patterns,
workflows, and user preferences that regex-based pattern matching might miss.

## Why LLM Analysis?

### Limitations of Regex Pattern Matching

- Can only detect exact or near-exact phrase matches
- Misses semantic variations (e.g., "check qdrant for info" vs "use your qdrant to get context")
- Cannot understand context or intent
- Requires predefined patterns

### Advantages of LLM Analysis

- Understands semantic meaning and variations
- Detects complex multi-step workflows
- Identifies user preferences and habits
- Provides confidence scores for patterns
- Suggests context-aware automations

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

```
User Messages → Batch Processing → Claude 3.5 Sonnet → Pattern Extraction → Evolution System
```

### Key Components

1. **LLM Pattern Analyzer** (`evolve-llm-analyzer.ts`)
   - Processes messages in batches of 50 to avoid token limits
   - Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet (cost-effective, fast model)
   - Extracts multiple pattern types:
     - Workflow patterns
     - Tool usage patterns
     - User preferences
     - Repeated phrases

2. **Integration with Evolution Command**

   ```bash
   dgmo evolve --generate --llm-analysis
   ```

3. **Pattern Types Detected**

   **Workflow Patterns**
   - Sequential tasks ("first X then Y")
   - Tool combinations ("use A to do B")
   - Common task sequences

   **Tool Usage Patterns**
   - Which tools are used for what purposes
   - Frequency of tool combinations
   - Common use cases per tool

   **User Preferences**
   - Preferred approaches
   - Common phrases and instructions
   - Habitual patterns

## Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
# Run evolution with LLM analysis
dgmo evolve --generate --llm-analysis

# With verbose output to see details
dgmo evolve --generate --llm-analysis --verbose
```

### Example Output

```
→ Analyzing 371 messages in 8 batches with Claude 3.5 Sonnet...
  Processing batch 1/8...
  Processing batch 2/8...
  ...

✓ LLM analysis complete. Found 12 patterns.

Top patterns detected:
  - Use Qdrant for context retrieval (8 times, confidence: 0.95)
  - Sequential workflow: analyze then implement (5 times, confidence: 0.87)
  - Create parallel agents for complex tasks (4 times, confidence: 0.92)
  - Use prompting MCP for optimization (6 times, confidence: 0.89)
```

### Generated Automations

Based on detected patterns, the system generates automations like:

1. **System Message Updates**

   ```javascript
   // If "use qdrant for context" appears 5+ times
   "IMPORTANT: Before starting any task, ALWAYS:
   1. Search Qdrant for relevant context
   2. Review related memories
   3. Use this context to inform your approach"
   ```

2. **Workflow Macros**

   ```javascript
   // If "first analyze then implement" pattern detected
   async function analyzeAndImplement(task) {
     const analysis = await analyzeTask(task);
     const implementation = await implement(analysis);
     return implementation;
   }
   ```

3. **Tool Auto-Invocation**
   ```javascript
   // If prompting MCP used before complex tasks
   if (taskComplexity > threshold) {
     await promptingMCP.optimize(approach);
   }
   ```

## Cost Considerations

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~$3 per million input tokens
- Average session: ~1000 tokens
- 500 sessions analysis: ~$1.50
- Batching reduces API calls and costs

## Testing

### Test Script

```bash
# Run test with sample messages
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key bun run test-llm-evolution.ts
```

### Test Messages Include

- Qdrant context patterns
- Prompting MCP patterns
- Sequential workflows
- Parallel agent requests
- Memory/storage patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Model Support**
   - Add support for other LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini)
   - Model selection based on cost/performance

2. **Pattern Confidence Tuning**
   - Adjust thresholds based on pattern type
   - Learn optimal confidence levels

3. **Real-Time Analysis**
   - Analyze patterns during sessions
   - Suggest automations immediately

4. **Pattern Visualization**
   - Dashboard showing detected patterns
   - Trend analysis over time

## Technical Details

### LLM Prompt Structure

```
Analyze user messages and extract:
1. Repeated workflow patterns
2. Tool usage patterns
3. Common task sequences
4. User preferences
5. Phrases appearing 3+ times

Return JSON with:
- Pattern type and description
- Frequency count
- Example messages
- Suggested automation
- Confidence score (0-1)
```

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if LLM fails
- Batch retry logic
- Rate limit handling
- JSON parsing fallbacks

### Performance

- Batch processing: 50 messages per request
- 1-second delay between batches
- Typical analysis: 30-60 seconds for 500 sessions
- Results cached for subsequent runs

## Conclusion

LLM-based pattern analysis represents a significant leap forward in the DGMO Evolution System's
ability to understand and adapt to user behavior. By combining regex patterns with semantic
understanding, the system can now detect subtle usage patterns and generate more intelligent
automations, moving us closer to a truly adaptive AI assistant.
