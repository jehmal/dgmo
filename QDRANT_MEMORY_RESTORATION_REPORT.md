## Backup Procedures Documentation

### Automatic Snapshot Creation

```bash
# Create snapshot manually
curl -X POST "http://localhost:6333/collections/AgentMemories/snapshots"

# Using Qdrant MCP tools
qdrant_qdrant-create-snapshot --collection_name AgentMemories
```

### Snapshot Restoration (if needed)

```bash
# List available snapshots
curl "http://localhost:6333/collections/AgentMemories/snapshots"

# Restore from snapshot (replace SNAPSHOT_NAME)
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:6333/collections/AgentMemories/snapshots/SNAPSHOT_NAME/recover"
```

### Recommended Backup Schedule

- **Daily:** Automatic snapshot creation
- **Weekly:** Verify snapshot integrity
- **Monthly:** Archive old snapshots
- **Before major changes:** Manual snapshot creation

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check collection health
curl "http://localhost:6333/collections/AgentMemories"

# Count memories
curl "http://localhost:6333/collections/AgentMemories/points/count"

# Health check
curl "http://localhost:6333/health"
```

## Recovery Procedures

### If Collection is Lost

1. **Stop Qdrant service**
2. **Restore from latest snapshot:**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT "http://localhost:6333/collections/AgentMemories/snapshots/AgentMemories-8477207722202073-2025-07-06-15-09-54.snapshot/recover"
   ```
3. **Verify restoration:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:6333/collections/AgentMemories/points/count"
   ```
4. **Test search functionality**

### If Qdrant Server is Down

1. **Check server status:** `systemctl status qdrant` or `docker ps`
2. **Restart service:** `systemctl restart qdrant` or `docker restart qdrant`
3. **Verify collections:** `curl "http://localhost:6333/collections"`
4. **Test basic operations**

## System Health Metrics

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Search Response Time:** < 100ms
