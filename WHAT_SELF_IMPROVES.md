# 🧬 What Self-Improves in DGMO?

DGMO tracks your usage patterns and evolves its tools to work better for YOU specifically. Here's what improves:

## 1. 🛠️ **Error Handling & Recovery**

**What it tracks:** Common errors you encounter
**How it improves:** Adds automatic fixes for recurring issues

**Example:**
```bash
# You frequently get "permission denied" errors
dgmo run "edit /etc/hosts"
# Error: permission denied

# After evolution, DGMO learns to:
- Detect permission errors
- Automatically suggest sudo
- Or create a local copy first
- Result: No more manual permission fixes!
```

## 2. 📁 **File Operation Patterns**

**What it tracks:** How you work with files
**How it improves:** Optimizes based on your workflow

**Example:**
```bash
# You often edit multiple files in sequence
dgmo run "update all Python imports in src/"
# Currently: Opens each file separately (slow)

# After evolution, DGMO learns to:
- Batch file operations
- Use more efficient search patterns
- Cache frequently accessed directories
- Result: 3x faster file modifications!
```

## 3. 🐚 **Command Execution Intelligence**

**What it tracks:** Bash commands that fail/succeed
**How it improves:** Learns your environment quirks

**Example:**
```bash
# You work on a system where 'python' means Python 2
dgmo run "create a Python web server"
# Keeps failing with syntax errors

# After evolution, DGMO learns:
- Your system needs 'python3' not 'python'
- Your pip is 'pip3'
- Your preferred virtual env setup
- Result: Commands work first time!
```

## 4. 🔄 **Retry & Timeout Strategies**

**What it tracks:** Network and long-running operations
**How it improves:** Adapts timeouts and retry logic

**Example:**
```bash
# You have slow internet, web fetches timeout
dgmo run "analyze this GitHub repo"
# Timeout errors

# After evolution, DGMO learns:
- Increase timeout for your connection
- Add exponential backoff retries
- Cache successful fetches
- Result: Reliable network operations!
```

## 5. 🎯 **Tool Selection Optimization**

**What it tracks:** Which tools work best for which tasks
**How it improves:** Chooses better tools over time

**Example:**
```bash
# You work with large codebases
dgmo run "find all TODO comments"
# Currently uses basic grep (slow)

# After evolution, DGMO learns:
- You have ripgrep installed
- Ripgrep is 10x faster for your repos
- Certain patterns work better
- Result: Instant searches!
```

## 6. 🧹 **Code Style Adaptation**

**What it tracks:** Your coding patterns and preferences
**How it improves:** Generates code matching your style

**Example:**
```bash
# You always use specific patterns
dgmo run "create a new React component"
# Generic template

# After evolution, DGMO learns:
- You prefer functional components
- You use TypeScript
- Your naming conventions
- Your import structure
- Result: Code that matches your style!
```

## 7. 💾 **Resource Usage Patterns**

**What it tracks:** Memory and CPU usage
**How it improves:** Optimizes for your system

**Example:**
```bash
# You work on a low-memory system
dgmo run "process large CSV file"
# Runs out of memory

# After evolution, DGMO learns:
- Stream processing instead of loading all
- Chunk operations for your RAM size
- Clean up temporary files faster
- Result: Works on your hardware!
```

## 8. 🔍 **Search and Navigation**

**What it tracks:** How you search and navigate code
**How it improves:** Learns your project structures

**Example:**
```bash
# You have consistent project layouts
dgmo run "find the main configuration"
# Searches everywhere (slow)

# After evolution, DGMO learns:
- Your configs are always in config/ or .config/
- Your test files follow __tests__ pattern
- Your docs are in docs/ not documentation/
- Result: Finds files instantly!
```

## Real Evolution Example:

```bash
# Day 1-7: You use DGMO normally
dgmo run "various tasks..."

# Day 8: Check what it learned
dgmo evolve --analyze

Output:
Performance Summary
──────────────────
Total Operations: 342
Success Rate: 78.3%

Common Error Patterns:
  ! permission denied (12 occurrences)
  ! python not found (8 occurrences)
  ! timeout errors (5 occurrences)

Evolution Suggestions:
⚡ Add automatic sudo detection for system files
⚡ Default to python3 for Python operations
⚡ Increase network timeouts by 2x

# Apply improvements
dgmo evolve --auto-apply

# Now DGMO handles these issues automatically!
```

## The Magic: It's Personal! 🪄

Unlike generic AI assistants, DGMO learns YOUR:
- System configuration
- Project structures  
- Coding style
- Common tasks
- Error patterns
- Performance needs

It literally evolves to become YOUR perfect coding assistant!
