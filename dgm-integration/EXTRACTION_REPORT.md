# Component Extraction Report

## Summary

Successfully extracted and simplified reusable components from the DGMSTT complex architecture into a lightweight `dgm-integration` module suitable for OpenCode integration.

## Extracted Components

### 1. From `/protocol/` - TypeScript-Python Bridge Code

**Original Components:**
- `protocol/python/bridge.py` - Complex execution bridge with full protocol support
- `protocol/python/types.py` - Comprehensive type definitions
- `protocol/typescript/src/bridge.ts` - TypeScript bridge implementation

**Simplified To:**
- `dgm-integration/src/dgm-bridge.ts` - Lightweight subprocess communication
- `dgm-integration/python/bridge.py` - Simple JSON-RPC server
- Removed complex protocol negotiations and multi-language support
- Focused on direct TypeScript ↔ Python communication only

### 2. From `/dgm/` - Core Agent Files

**Referenced (Not Copied):**
- `coding_agent.py` - Core agent logic
- `llm_withtools.py` - LLM integration with tools

**Created Adapter:**
- `dgm-integration/python/adapter.py` - Simple interface to DGM agent
- Provides evolution, testing, and deployment methods
- Handles imports and initialization of DGM components

### 3. From `/shared/types/` - Type Definitions

**Original Components:**
- Complex multi-file type system with cross-language support
- Pydantic models with full validation
- Extensive JSON Schema support

**Simplified To:**
- `dgm-integration/src/types.ts` - Essential TypeScript interfaces only
- Removed unnecessary abstractions and complex generics
- Focused on tool execution and evolution needs

### 4. From `/dgm/tools/` - Tool Implementations

**Extracted Pattern:**
- `tools/bash.py` - Bash execution tool
- `tools/edit.py` - File editing tool

**Created Wrapper:**
- `dgm-integration/python/tool_wrapper.py` - Simplified tool interface
- Provides clean abstraction without DGM dependencies
- Allows easy tool registration and execution

## Simplifications Made

### 1. Removed Complex Dependencies
- ❌ RabbitMQ message queuing
- ❌ Redis caching and state management  
- ❌ Complex event systems
- ❌ Multi-service orchestration
- ✅ Direct subprocess communication only

### 2. Simplified Communication Protocol
- ❌ Full JSON-RPC 2.0 with batching
- ❌ WebSocket support
- ❌ Multi-protocol support
- ✅ Simple request/response over stdin/stdout
- ✅ Basic JSON-RPC for method calls

### 3. Streamlined Type System
- ❌ Complex type converters and validators
- ❌ Cross-language type generation
- ❌ Extensive metadata structures
- ✅ Simple TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Basic type checking only

### 4. Direct File-Based Storage
- ❌ Database integration
- ❌ Complex state management
- ✅ Simple JSON file storage
- ✅ Directory-based organization

## Integration Points Identified

### 1. OpenCode Tool Execution
```typescript
// Hook into tool execution
afterToolExecution(result) {
  tracker.track({
    toolName: tool.name,
    executionTime: result.duration,
    success: result.success,
    error: result.error
  });
}
```

### 2. Evolution Trigger Points
- Manual: `opencode evolve` command
- Scheduled: Cron job or interval
- Threshold: After N executions
- Event: On repeated failures

### 3. Tool Registration
```typescript
// Register OpenCode tools with DGM
for (const tool of openCodeTools) {
  await toolSync.registerTool({
    id: tool.id,
    name: tool.name,
    description: tool.description,
    schema: tool.inputSchema
  });
}
```

## Benefits of Simplified Architecture

1. **Minimal Disruption**: Can be added to OpenCode without major changes
2. **Easy Debugging**: Simple subprocess communication is easy to trace
3. **No Infrastructure**: No additional services to manage
4. **Gradual Adoption**: Can start with performance tracking only
5. **Clear Boundaries**: Clean separation between OpenCode and DGM

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Phase 1**: Add performance tracking to OpenCode tools
2. **Phase 2**: Set up DGM bridge subprocess
3. **Phase 3**: Implement evolution command
4. **Phase 4**: Add improvement review UI
5. **Phase 5**: Implement auto-deployment with rollback

## Conclusion

The extraction successfully created a lightweight bridge between OpenCode and DGM by:
- Removing all complex orchestration and messaging systems
- Simplifying to direct subprocess communication
- Preserving core functionality for tool evolution
- Maintaining clean separation of concerns

This simplified architecture makes it feasible to add self-improving capabilities to OpenCode without requiring significant infrastructure changes.
