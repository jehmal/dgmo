### 5. Performance Degradation Testing (`performance`)

**Purpose**: Validates recovery performance under resource constraints.

**What it tests**:

- Disk I/O performance
- Recovery time under load

**Success criteria**:

- Recovery completes within time thresholds
- Memory usage stays within limits
- Disk I/O performance acceptable
- No significant performance degradation

### 6. Rollback Procedures (`rollback`)

**Purpose**: Tests ability to rollback to previous stable states.

**What it tests**:

- Multiple backup version handling
- Automatic rollback when latest version is corrupted
- Version selection logic

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Recovery Testing
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Daily at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  recovery-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Recovery Tests
        run: ./test-recovery.sh --ci
      - name: Upload Reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: recovery-reports
          path: recovery-tests/reports/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Qdrant Connection Failed

```bash
# Check Qdrant status
curl http://localhost:6333/health

# Start Qdrant if needed
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

#### 2. Insufficient Disk Space

```bash
# Check available space
df -h

# Clean up old test data
rm -rf recovery-tests/temp/*
```

#### 3. Permission Errors

```bash
# Fix script permissions
chmod +x test-recovery.sh

# Fix directory permissions
chmod -R 755 recovery-tests/
```

#### 4. Missing Dependencies

```bash
# Install required tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl jq bc

# Verify installation
./test-recovery.sh --help
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
./test-recovery.sh --verbose

# Skip cleanup to inspect test data
./test-recovery.sh --skip-cleanup

# Generate test data for manual inspection
./test-recovery.sh --generate-data
```

## Best Practices

### Regular Testing Schedule

1. **Daily**: Quick tests (`--quick`) in CI/CD
2. **Weekly**: Full test suite on staging environment
3. **Monthly**: Performance baseline updates
4. **Before releases**: Complete test suite with manual review

### Monitoring and Alerting

```bash
# Set up monitoring for test failures
./test-recovery.sh --ci
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    # Send alert to monitoring system
    curl -X POST "https://monitoring.example.com/alert" \
         -d "Recovery tests failed - check reports"
fi
```

### Data Retention

- Keep test reports for at least 30 days
- Archive performance metrics for trend analysis
- Rotate test data to prevent disk space issues
- Backup test configurations and scripts

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Scenarios

Create custom test scenarios by extending the framework:

```bash
# Add custom test function
test_custom_scenario() {
    local test_name="custom_scenario"
    local start_time=$(date +%s)

    # Your custom test logic here

    local end_time=$(date +%s)
    local duration=$((end_time - start_time))
    record_test_result "$test_name" "PASS" "$duration" "Custom test details"
}
```

### Performance Baselines

Establish performance baselines for your environment:

```bash
# Run baseline tests
./test-recovery.sh --scenario performance > baseline.log

# Compare against baseline
./test-recovery.sh --scenario performance | diff baseline.log -
```

### Integration Testing

Combine with other testing frameworks:

```bash
# Run recovery tests as part of larger test suite
./test-recovery.sh --ci --quick
pytest integration_tests/
./test-recovery.sh --scenario qdrant
```

environments. However, always test in a staging environment first and ensure you have proper backups
before running recovery tests.
