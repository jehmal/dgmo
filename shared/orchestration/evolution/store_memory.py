information = """DGMSTT Phase 3 Evolution Engine Implementation Progress:

Successfully implemented Evolution Engine core components:
1. population-manager.ts - Complete with DGM-compatible parent selection (score_prop, score_child_prop), Redis persistence, generation management
2. fitness-evaluator.ts - Complete with SWE-bench/Polyglot evaluation, resource constraints, parallel evaluation support
3. evolution-events.ts - Complete event system with typed events, RabbitMQ publishers, monitoring integration
4. evolution-metrics.ts - Complete Prometheus metrics for evolution tracking (fitness, generations, success rates)
5. RabbitMQ configuration - Already had evolution exchange, queues, and bindings properly configured

Still needed:
- evolution-engine.ts (main orchestrator)
- Python bridge files (evolution_bridge.py, dgm_adapter.py)
- Integration with agent-orchestrator.ts

Architecture successfully bridges DGM's Python evolution loop with TypeScript orchestration layer."""
