# DGMO LLM Pattern Analysis - Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified

The initial implementation was trying to analyze all messages from all sessions at once (153
messages in 4 batches), which was overwhelming the LLM and causing parsing failures.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Session-by-Session Analysis

- Changed from analyzing all messages together to analyzing each session individually
- Each session's messages are analyzed separately to maintain context
- Limits analysis to 20 sessions maximum to control API costs

### 2. Message Limiting

- Caps messages per session to 50 to avoid token limits
- Skips sessions with fewer than 5 messages (not enough data)
- Processes messages in batches of 20 (reduced from 50)

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- Better error messages showing actual LLM errors
- Graceful fallback when parsing fails
- Session-level error handling (one failed session doesn't stop others)

### 4. Rate Limiting

- 500ms delay between session analyses
- 1000ms delay between batches within a session
- Prevents hitting API rate limits

## Code Changes

### evolve.ts

```typescript
// Before: Collected all messages into one array
const allUserMessages: string[] = [];

// After: Store messages by session
const sessionMessages: Map<string, string[]> = new Map();

// Process each session individually
for (const [sessionId, messages] of sessionMessages) {
  // Analyze up to 50 messages per session
  const sessionPatterns = await analyzePatternsWithLLM(
    messages.slice(0, 50),
    anthropicToken,
    verbose,
  );
}
```

### evolve-llm-analyzer.ts

```typescript
// Reduced batch size
batchSize: number = 20, // Was 50

// Better error reporting
if (verbose) {
  UI.println(`LLM error: ${error}`)
}
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run with LLM analysis (analyzes up to 20 sessions)
dgmo evolve --generate --llm-analysis

# Run with verbose output to see errors
dgmo evolve --generate --llm-analysis --verbose
```

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Can handle hundreds of sessions without overwhelming the LLM
2. **Context Preservation**: Each session analyzed with its full context
3. **Cost Control**: Limits API calls to reasonable amount
4. **Better Debugging**: Verbose mode shows exactly what's failing
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues even if some sessions fail

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Need to verify the LLM correctly parses individual session messages
2. **Tune Prompts**: May need to adjust the analysis prompt for better results
3. **Add Caching**: Cache analyzed sessions to avoid re-analyzing
4. **Pattern Aggregation**: Improve how patterns from different sessions are merged

## Expected Behavior

When running `dgmo evolve --generate --llm-analysis`:

1. Loads all sessions (e.g., 371 sessions)
2. Filters to sessions with 5+ messages
3. Analyzes up to 20 sessions individually
4. Each session processed in batches of 20 messages
5. Merges detected patterns across all analyzed sessions
6. Generates code improvements based on patterns

This approach ensures the LLM has enough context to understand patterns within each conversation
while avoiding token limits and API overload.
