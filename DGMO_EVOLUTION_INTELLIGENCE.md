## Core Capabilities

### 1. User Intent Pattern Detection

Analyze natural language patterns to understand what users really want:

- **Feature Request Detection**
  - Phrases like "do this in qdrant", "store this", "remember this"
  - Identify when users ask for features that don't exist yet
  - Track repeated requests for similar functionality
  - Detect workflow patterns (e.g., always grep before edit)
  - Identify frustration signals ("why doesn't this work", "try again")

- **Hidden Feature Requests**
  - "make this responsive" → suggests CSS framework integration need
  - "use prettier to format" → auto-configure prettier as default
  - "check all files for" → enhanced search tool needed

### 2. Automatic Slash Command Generation

Dynamically create commands based on usage patterns:

- **Common Patterns → Commands**
  - "search for X in all files" → `/search` command
  - "create 3 agents to..." → `/parallel-agents` command
  - "show me all my recent changes" → `/recent-edits` command
  - "what did we do yesterday" → `/history` command
  - Generate command aliases based on common misspellings

- **Project-Specific Commands**
  - Detect repeated workflows → custom macros
  - Common file operations → batch commands
  - Frequent queries → saved searches

### 3. Agent Behavior Customization

```typescript
interface UserPattern {
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  pattern: {
    type: PatternType;
    content: string;
    context: Context;
    frequency: number;
    confidence: number;
  };
}
```

### Pattern Recognition Engine

```typescript
class PatternRecognizer {
  // Analyze message content
  detectIntent(message: string): Intent[];

  // Track command sequences
  detectWorkflow(commands: Command[]): Workflow;

  // Identify preferences

  // Predict next action
  predictNextAction(context: Context): Action[];
}
```
