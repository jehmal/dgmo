# Go Fixes Applied to DGMSTT Codebase

## Summary
Fixed critical Go issues including nil pointer risks, goroutine leaks, and error handling across the DGMSTT codebase.

## Files Fixed

### 1. app.go (/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui/internal/app/app.go)

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Line 234**: Fixed `getDefaultModel` to handle case where no models exist
  - Added proper map key existence check
  - Added nil return safety when provider has no models

- **Line 273**: Don't set Session before checking if Init succeeds
  - Moved session assignment to after successful init
  - Added timeout context for initialization

- **Line 275-284**: Added timeout/cancellation to goroutine
  - Created context with 30-second timeout
  - Proper cleanup with defer cancel()

- **Line 290-298**: Added timeout/cancellation to CompactSession goroutine
  - Created context with 60-second timeout
  - Proper cleanup with defer cancel()

- **Line 459-461**: Used sort.SliceStable for better sorting
  - Changed from sort.Slice to sort.SliceStable
  - Fixed comparison to avoid integer overflow

- **Line 549**: Handle nil session properly in LoadSession
  - Already properly handled with error return

- **Added**: Proper shutdown method for cleanup
  - Added shutdown context and cancel function
  - Added WaitGroup for goroutine tracking
  - Added Shutdown() method with timeout

### 2. task_client.go (/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui/internal/app/task_client.go)

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Line 256**: Replaced busy wait with proper ticker/backoff
  - Replaced sleep loop with ticker and select
  - Added context cancellation check
  - Proper timeout handling

- **Line 484**: Check conn is not nil before setting deadline
  - Added RLock/RUnlock for safe conn access
  - Nil check before SetReadDeadline

- **Lines 324, 327, 463-475**: Added proper goroutine tracking and cleanup
  - Added WaitGroup for goroutine lifecycle
  - Added goroutine context and cancel
  - Proper cleanup in Disconnect()

- **Lines 635-667**: Added context cancellation check in cleanup goroutines
  - Added WaitGroup tracking
  - Added context cancellation via select
  - Replaced sleep with time.After

- **Prevented**: Multiple simultaneous reconnection attempts
  - Added reconnecting flag
  - Mutex protection for reconnection state

- **Used**: iota for ConnectionState constants (already implemented)

### 3. tui.go (/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui/internal/tui/tui.go)

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Line 823**: Added proper synchronization for continuationTaskID access
  - Added continuationMutex (sync.RWMutex)
  - Protected all reads and writes to continuation fields

- **Line 1420**: Validate JSON structure before type assertion
  - Added proper type switch for TaskID handling
  - Handle string, map[string]interface{}, and unexpected types
  - Added warning log for unexpected types

### 4. main.go (/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui/cmd/dgmo/main.go)

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Lines 180-191**: Added cleanup for WebSocket goroutine
  - Added defer cancel() to ensure context cleanup
  - Proper error handling maintained

- **Lines 193-203**: Handle cleanup for event streaming goroutine
  - Added done channel for graceful shutdown
  - Added timeout for goroutine cleanup
  - Call app.Shutdown() on exit

### 5. messages.go (/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui/internal/components/chat/messages.go)

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Line 117**: Added nil check for m.app.Messages
  - Initialize to empty slice if nil
  - Prevents panic on nil dereference

## Key Improvements

1. **Context Usage**: All goroutines now use proper context with timeouts
2. **Goroutine Lifecycle**: Added WaitGroup tracking and graceful shutdown
3. **Thread Safety**: Added mutexes for shared state access
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error wrapping with %w where applicable
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup methods and defer statements
6. **Nil Safety**: Added checks to prevent nil pointer dereferences

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test graceful shutdown with active connections
2. Test reconnection logic under network failures
3. Test continuation prompt generation with concurrent access
4. Test model selection with empty provider lists
5. Test message rendering with nil message arrays
