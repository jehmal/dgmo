```

### Update Flow

```
1. Check for updates → CDN API
2. Download differential patch
3. Create rollback snapshot
4. Apply update atomically
5. Verify installation
6. Restart if required
```

### Evolution Flow

```
1. Analyze usage patterns
2. Generate improvements
3. Convert to plugins
4. Test in sandbox
5. User approval
6. Apply as plugin/patch
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Plugin-Based Evolution

- Evolution system works without source code
- Changes implemented as hot-loadable plugins
- Safe sandboxed execution

### 2. Atomic Updates

- Differential patches minimize download size
- Snapshot-based instant rollback
- Zero-downtime updates

### 3. Universal Installation

- Single command works on all platforms
- Automatic environment configuration
- Package manager integration

### 4. Self-Healing

- Automatic corruption detection
- Binary repair without reinstallation
- Configuration recovery

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Binary Size**: Mitigated by aggressive optimization and compression
2. **Platform Compatibility**: Extensive testing matrix, gradual rollout
3. **Update Failures**: Snapshot system ensures always-working state

### Security Risks

1. **Supply Chain**: Code signing, checksum verification
2. **Plugin Security**: Sandboxed execution, permission system
3. **Update Security**: Signed updates, secure channels

## Success Metrics

### Launch Metrics (Month 1)

- Installation success rate: >99%
- Binary size: <50MB
- Startup time: <500ms
- Platform coverage: Windows, macOS, Linux

### Growth Metrics (Month 3)

## Conclusion

This implementation plan transforms DGMO into a consumer-ready product while maintaining its
self-improving capabilities. The plugin-based evolution system and robust update mechanism ensure
users can benefit from continuous improvements without technical complexity.

The key to success is maintaining simplicity for end users while building sophisticated systems
underneath. With careful execution of this plan, DGMO will become the first truly self-improving
consumer developer tool.
