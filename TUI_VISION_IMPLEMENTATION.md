# DGMO TUI Vision Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented vision capabilities for DGMO's TUI (Terminal User Interface) written in Go.
The implementation mirrors the TypeScript CLI functionality, allowing users to include image paths
in their messages for AI analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

1. **Image Detection Module** (`/opencode/packages/tui/internal/image/detector.go`)
   - `IsImageFile(path string) bool` - Checks if a file is an image
   - `ExtractImagePaths(text string) []string` - Extracts all image paths from text
   - Supports: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP formats
   - Handles quoted paths, backtick paths, and unquoted paths

2. **Image Encoding Module** (`/opencode/packages/tui/internal/image/encoder.go`)
   - `ReadImageAsBase64(path string) (string, error)` - Reads and encodes images
   - `GetMimeType(path string) string` - Returns proper MIME type
   - `ConvertWindowsPath(path string) string` - Handles Windows to WSL conversion
   - 5MB size limit enforcement
   - Returns data URLs in format: `data:image/png;base64,...`

3. **TUI Integration** (`/opencode/packages/tui/internal/app/app.go`)
   - Modified `SendChatMessage` to detect and process images
   - Uses `FilePartParam` from opencode-sdk-go
   - Provides user feedback for loaded/failed images
   - Graceful error handling - text always sent even if images fail

### Key Features

- **Automatic Detection**: No special syntax needed, just mention image paths
- **Multiple Images**: Support for multiple images in one message
- **Path Flexibility**: Handles Windows (`C:\path\image.png`), WSL (`/mnt/c/path/image.png`), and
  relative paths
- **User Feedback**: Shows ✅ for loaded images, ❌ for failures
- **Error Resilience**: Failed images don't block message sending
- **Size Limits**: 5MB maximum per image (Claude API limit)

## Usage Examples

In the TUI (start with `dgmo`):

```
# Single image
analyze screenshot.png

# Multiple images
compare before.jpg and after.jpg

# Windows path
look at C:\Users\name\Desktop\photo.png

# Quoted paths
check "my image.png" for issues

# Relative and absolute paths work
analyze ./images/diagram.gif
analyze /home/user/picture.webp
```

## Testing

All components have comprehensive tests:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/AI/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui
go test ./internal/image -v
```

Test coverage includes:

- Image file detection
- Path extraction patterns
- Windows path conversion
- MIME type detection
- Base64 encoding
- Error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Message Flow

1. User types message with image paths
2. `ExtractImagePaths` finds all image references
3. For each image:
   - Convert Windows paths if needed
   - Read file and check size
   - Encode to base64 data URL
   - Create `FilePartParam` with proper MIME type
4. Send message with mixed text and file parts
5. Show feedback to user

### SDK Integration

Uses the official opencode-sdk-go types:

- `MessagePartUnionParam` interface for mixed content
- `TextPartParam` for text content
- `FilePartParam` for images (with URL, MediaType, Filename)

## Verification

The implementation has been:

- ✅ Fully tested with comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Successfully compiled with no errors
- ✅ Integrated with existing TUI infrastructure
- ✅ Follows Go best practices and conventions
- ✅ Matches CLI functionality exactly

## Next Steps

To use the vision capabilities:

1. Build the TUI: `cd opencode/packages/tui && go build ./cmd/dgmo`
2. Run DGMO: `dgmo`
3. Type messages with image paths
4. See AI analyze your images!

The TUI now has full parity with the CLI for vision capabilities, providing a seamless multimodal
experience in the terminal.
