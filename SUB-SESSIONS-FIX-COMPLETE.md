# Sub-Sessions Fix Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What I Fixed

The TUI's `/sub-sessions` command was only looking for sub-sessions of the CURRENT session. I've updated it to use a three-strategy approach:

### 1. **Direct Children Strategy**
First, it looks for sub-sessions that are direct children of the current session.

### 2. **Sibling Strategy** 
If the current session has a parent (meaning you're IN a sub-session), it also fetches sibling sub-sessions from the same parent.

### 3. **All Sub-Sessions Strategy**
As a fallback, it fetches ALL sub-sessions in the system and shows the most recent ones with context.

## Changes Made to `subsession.go`

1. **Enhanced `loadSubSessions()` function**:
   - Now tries multiple strategies to find relevant sub-sessions
   - Adds `_displayType` and `_note` fields to distinguish context
   - Provides comprehensive debug logging

2. **Updated display**:
   - Shows `[Sibling]` prefix for sibling sub-sessions
   - Shows parent context for sub-sessions from other parents
   - Maintains all existing functionality

3. **Better data structure**:
   - Added `displayType` and `note` fields to `subSessionItem`
   - Properly handles the new metadata

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Rebuild the TUI**:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/AI/DGMSTT
   chmod +x rebuild-tui.sh
   ./rebuild-tui.sh
   ```

2. **Install the fixed binary**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/AI/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui/dgmo /usr/local/bin/
   ```

3. **Test it**:
   ```bash
   dgmo
   # Create a session: "test session"
   # Run task tool: "Create 2 agents to test"
   # Check sub-sessions: /sub-sessions
   ```

## Expected Behavior

Now when you run `/sub-sessions`:

1. **If you're in a parent session**: Shows all child sub-sessions
2. **If you're in a child session**: Shows sibling sub-sessions with `[Sibling]` prefix
3. **If no direct relations found**: Shows recent sub-sessions from all parents

## Debug Output

The fix includes debug logging prefixed with `[SUB-SESSION FIX]` to help trace what's happening:
- Shows current session ID and parent ID
- Reports how many sub-sessions found with each strategy
- Shows total sub-sessions being displayed

This comprehensive fix ensures you'll always see relevant sub-sessions regardless of which session you're currently in!
